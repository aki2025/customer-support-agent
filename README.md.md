 AI Customer Support Agent with Memory
This Streamlit app implements an AI-powered customer support agent for synthetic data generated using GPT-4o. The agent uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model and maintains a memory of past interactions using the Mem0 library with Qdrant as the vector store.

Features
Chat interface for interacting with the AI customer support agent
Persistent memory of customer interactions and profiles
Synthetic data generation for testing and demonstration
Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o model for intelligent responses
How to get Started?
Clone the GitHub repository
git clone 
cd 
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure vetor database Qdrant is running: The app expects Qdrant to be running on localhost:6333. Adjust the configuration in the code if your setup is different.

docker pull qdrant/qdrant

docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    qdrant/qdrant

Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run customer_sup_main.py

Creating an AI Customer Support Agent with Memory involves building a system that can handle customer queries, remember past interactions, and provide personalized responses. This can be achieved using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and memory storage (e.g., databases or vector stores).

Below is a step-by-step guide to building such a system:

Key Features of an AI Customer Support Agent with Memory
Conversation Memory: Remember past interactions with customers.

Contextual Understanding: Use context from previous conversations to provide personalized responses.

Natural Language Processing: Understand and generate human-like responses.

Integration with Backend: Fetch relevant data (e.g., order history, account details) from databases or APIs.

Scalability: Handle multiple customers simultaneously.

Step 1: Choose a Framework or Library
You can use the following tools to build the AI agent:

OpenAI GPT (or similar LLMs): For generating human-like responses.

LangChain: For managing memory and context in conversations.

Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate): For storing and retrieving conversation history.

Backend Frameworks (e.g., Flask, FastAPI): For building the API layer.

Frontend (e.g., React, Streamlit): For the user interface.

Step 2: Set Up Memory Storage
To enable memory, you need to store and retrieve past interactions. Here are two approaches:

Database Storage:

Use a SQL or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store conversation history.

Each customer interaction is saved with a unique user ID and timestamp.

Vector Storage:

Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) to store embeddings of past conversations.

This allows for semantic search and retrieval of relevant context.

Step 3: Build the AI Agent
Here’s an example using OpenAI GPT and LangChain for memory management:

Install Required Libraries


pip install openai langchain

python

from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)

# Initialize memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

# Create a conversation chain with memory
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)

# Simulate a conversation
response1 = conversation.run("Hi, I'm John. I need help with my order.")
print("AI:", response1)

response2 = conversation.run("My order number is 12345.")
print("AI:", response2)

response3 = conversation.run("Can you check the status?")
print("AI:", response3)

# The AI will remember the context from previous interactions
Step 4: Add Backend Integration
To fetch customer-specific data (e.g., order status), integrate the AI agent with your backend systems.

Example: Fetch Order Status
python

def get_order_status(order_id):
    # Simulate a database or API call
    orders = {
        "12345": "Shipped",
        "67890": "Processing"
    }
    return orders.get(order_id, "Order not found")

# Modify the conversation to include backend data
response = conversation.run(f"Can you check the status of order 12345?")
order_status = get_order_status("12345")
print("AI:", f"The status of your order is {order_status}.")
Step 5: Add a User Interface
You can create a simple UI using Streamlit or React to interact with the AI agent.

Example: Streamlit UI
python

import streamlit as st
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the LLM and memory
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)

# Streamlit app
st.title("AI Customer Support Agent")

# Input box for user query
user_input = st.text_input("You: ")

if user_input:
    # Get AI response
    response = conversation.run(user_input)
    st.text_area("AI:", value=response, height=100)

    # Display conversation history
    st.write("Conversation History:")
    for message in memory.buffer:
        st.write(message)
Step 6: Deploy the System
Deploy the AI agent using:

Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.

APIs: Expose the agent as an API using Flask or FastAPI.

Advanced Features
Personalization:

Use customer profiles to tailor responses (e.g., name, preferences).

Multi-Turn Conversations:

Handle complex queries that require multiple steps.

Sentiment Analysis:

Detect customer emotions and adjust responses accordingly.

Integration with CRM:

Sync conversation history with tools like Salesforce or Zendesk.

Example Workflow
Customer: "Hi, I need help with my order."

AI: "Sure! Can you provide your order number?"

Customer: "It's 12345."

AI: "Thanks, John! Your order is shipped and will arrive by Friday."

Customer: "Can you change the delivery address?"

AI: "I’ll update the address for order 12345. Please provide the new address."
